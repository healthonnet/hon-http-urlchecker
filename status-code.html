        <h1>Most common HTTP Status Codes</h1>
      </div>
      <p class="lead text-justify">
        This is a list of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) response 
        status codes. HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP
        request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five
        classes: informational responses, successful responses, redirects,
        client errors, and servers errors.
      </p>
      <h2>Successful responses (2xx)</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        This class of status codes indicates the action requested by the client
        was received, understood, accepted, and processed successfully.
      </p>
      <dl class="status-code">
        <dt class="text-success">200 OK</dt>
        <dd>
          The request has succeeded. The meaning of a success varies depending on
          the HTTP method:
          <br />
          GET: The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the message 
          body.
          <br />
          HEAD: The entity headers are in the message body.
          <br />
          POST: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted
          in the message body.
          <br />
          TRACE: The message body contains the request message as received by
          the server
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <h2>Redirection messages (3xx)</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        This class of status code indicates the client must take additional
        action to complete the request. Many of these status codes are used in
        URL redirection.
      </p>
      <dl class="status-code">
        <dt class="text-primary">301 Moved Permanently</dt>
        <dd>
          This response code means that URI of requested resource has been
          changed. Probably, new URI would be given in the response.
        </dd>
        <dt class="text-primary">302 Found</dt>
        <dd>
          This response code means that URI of requested resource has been
          changed temporarily. New changes in the URI might be made in the future.
          Therefore, this same URI should be used by the client in future
          requests.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <h2>Client error responses (4xx)</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        The 4xx class of status code is intended for situations in which the
        client seems to have erred. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the
        server should include an entity containing an explanation of the error
        situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. These
        status codes are applicable to any request method. User agents should
        display any included entity to the user.
      </p>
      <dl class="status-code">
        <dt class="text-danger">400 Bad Request</dt>
        <dd>
          This response means that server could not understand the request due to
          invalid syntax.
        </dd>
        <dt class="text-danger">401 Unauthorized</dt>
        <dd>
          Authentication is needed to get requested response. This is similar to
          403, but in this case, authentication is possible.
        </dd>
        <dt class="text-danger">403 Forbidden</dt>
        <dd>
          Client does not have access rights to the content so server is
          rejecting to give proper response.
        </dd>
        <dt class="text-danger">404 Not Found</dt>
        <dd>
          Server can not find requested resource. This response code probably is
          most famous one due to its frequency to occur in web.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <h2>Server error responses (5xx)</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.</p>
      <dl class="status-code">
        <dt class="text-danger">500 Internal Server Error</dt>
        <dd>The server has encountered a situation it doesn't know how to handle.</dd>
        <dt class="text-danger">502 Bad Gateway</dt>
        <dd>
          This error response means that the server, while working as a gateway
          to get a response needed to handle the request, got an invalid response.
        </dd>
        <dt class="text-danger">503 Service Unavailable</dt>
        <dd>
          The server is not ready to handle the request. Common causes are a
          server that is down for maintenance or that is overloaded.
        </dd>
        <dt class="text-danger">504 Gateway Timeout</dt>
        <dd>
          This error response is given when the server is acting as a gateway
          and cannot get a response in time.
        </dd>
